# Consonant Value, Time Converter, and Positive Numbers Checker

This project contains three functions that perform different tasks:

1. Consonant Value: Calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string.

2. Time Converter: Converts 12-hour time to 24-hour time format.

3. Positive Numbers Checker: Checks if exactly two out of three given integers are positive numbers.

## Consonant Value

The `solve` function in this module calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a lowercase string. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except 'aeiou'. The function assigns values to consonants ('a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26) and calculates the value of each consonant substring.
 


## Time Converter

The convert_to_24_hour_format function converts a 12-hour time to 24-hour time format. It takes hours (1 to 12), minutes (0 to 59), and period ("am" or "pm") as input and returns a four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.


# Positive Numbers Checker

The check_positive_numbers function checks if exactly two out of three given integers are positive numbers. It returns True if the condition is met, otherwise False.
